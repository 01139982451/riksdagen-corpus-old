_Westac Project, 2020_

The full data set consists of multiple parts:

- Riksdagens protokoll between from 1921 until today in the [Parla-clarin](https://github.com/clarin-eric/parla-clarin) format
- Comprehensive list of MPs and cabinet members during this period
- Traceable logs of all curation and segmentation that has been applied on the original data 

## Basic use

A full dataset is available under the zip download on this page. The unzipped folder is structured in  the following manner

- Annual protocol files in the ```corpus/``` folder
- List of MPs ```db/protocol/members_of_parliament.csv```
- Curation and segmentation instances under ```db/curation/instances/YYYY/PROTOCOL_ID.csv``` and ```db/segmentation/instances/YYYY/PROTOCOL_ID.csv```, respectively

## Participate in curation

The corpora are large and automatically curated and segmented. If you find any errors, it is possible to submit corrections to them. This is documented in the [project wiki](https://github.com/welfare-state-analytics/riksdagen-corpus/wiki/Submit-corrections).
