# Protocol annotation

There should be a PDF scan of the page, as well as two text files in the folder:

- original.txt

- annotated.txt

The original file is for reference and future use, and should not be edited. The other file, annotated.txt, should have all OCR errors, missing line breaks, and so on corrected, as well as margin notations etc. removed. Incorrect or misspelled words should be replaced with correct ones, and not marked per se, in the following manner

original.txt

```
Page 10 Noises in the porliamentary hall. New session starts.
```

annotated.txt

```
Noises in the parliamentary hall.

New session starts.
```

In addition to the corrections, the ends and the beginnings of speeches should be annotated. THis is done by adding the following all-caps words:

- BEGINSPEECH
- ENDSPEECH


```
Noises in the parliamentary hall.

BEGINSPEECH Senator Sanders from Vermont utters:
Mister Speaker, I would like to discuss the current state of American healthcare. ENDSPEECH

More noises in the parliamentary hall.
```

As seen in the example, the tags surround the whole speech, including the introduction of the speaker.
